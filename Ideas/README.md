# Ideas


### Admin's notes
#### Should the ideas be organized by date? 
Out of all of the three categories (techniques, discoveries, ideas), ideas seem the most inherently a-temporal.

>  "We know that for a long time everything we do will be nothing more than the jumping off point for those who have the advantage of already being aware of our ultimate results. This is the meaning of the famous apothegm of Newton, when he said, "If I have seen further than other men, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants". - Norbert Wiener
