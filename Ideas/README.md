### Ideas, Philosophical Narratives, or, The Long Conversation
There is a long-standing, enduring conversation that affords the medium in which we come to understand our ideas. Often, our exposure is merely to an a leaf, or the underside of a leaf, with little visibility to see the whole leaf, the bark, the branch, the split of the branches, the knots of the tree, the places where growth stopped or restarted, no less the inner workings of the trunk, and maybe not even the roots. But they exist, and rather unlike a tree, they are almost entirely non-physical, and almost impossible to view in one glimpse or photograph their entirity. These conversations, especially on the Frontier, have been going on for centuries, millania - and although you may choose or be unable to choose to pursue understanding, listening, learning their language, or knowing the speakers, these conversations exist and have existed, just the same. 

A lover of wisdom, a "Philosopher", may seek out The Conversation. We all here in the 21st century almost inherentlyt 'stand on the shoulder of giants', but we may not realize our height, or its enhancement from the giants upon which we rest - no less how those giants themselves were situated in their own contexts; were situated within their own contemporary realities, preceding history, or the visions of the future they wonder about or aspired towards. Through many lineages, some competing and some obsolete, there are many threads weaved together; there is a humble irony to be observed that there is not a figure who solved every possible problem within a field of study, discipline, or arena. Countless ideas, words, conversations are unrecorded and lost forever - but some remain. Many papers now are written to various ends, but some aspire to respect and continue the conversation - the conversation which may be our greatest heritage as human beings on this pale blue dot. 
-- Jesse Parent

>  "We know that for a long time everything we do will be nothing more than the jumping off point for those who have the advantage of already being aware of our ultimate results. This is the meaning of the famous apothegm of Newton, when he said, "If I have seen further than other men, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants". - Norbert Wiener

> “Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.”    — Albert Einstein
