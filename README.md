# FrontierMap


## Repository for the FrontierMap project  

This repo is for a wide ranging collection of educational materials in order to create a wide range of primers for those interested in working on the advanced topics such as cognitive science, embodied cognition, and learning. The scope is inherently multidisciplinary, and the primary facet of the project will take some time to complete. As much as "map" of sorts aims to be a final deliverable, there will be shorter term items such as literature reviews, coding projects, and other products that will compromise the individual bricks to be stacked along the way, creating the foundation and structure of overall endeavor. 

This project is a slow-burn and will likely not be completed in a direct fashion. It is more a collection of puzzle pieces to be slowly put together in a grand narrative fashion, rather than creating a specific series of developments. Other Repos and projects will be more discrete chunks or efforts or products, along the way. 

### Collaboration
While this is a self-generated, I appreciate the guidenace of Dr Bradley Alicea of Orthogonal Lab. Therein, I am currenty a Post-Bac researcher in a variety of working groups, such as the *Modeling Neural Development with Braitenberg Vehicles* GSoC team, and *DevoWorm* under the banner of OpenWorm. Many of my projects within these working groups has led me to a broader ranging effort in organizing and mapping out the space in which these projects would be operating.

I appreciate collaborative and constructive input!

### Method
- Using GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks to store and create educational materials
- In the future, there may also be advances visualizations, interactive timelines, videos, and articles/blogposts created.
